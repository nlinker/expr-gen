## Haskell/Rust/Scala playground

The repo consists of some experiments and tasks done in Haskell.

- `expr-gen`:

The project contains the code to solve the task to generate valid expressions. Requires many not-so-basic
things like logic programming, type-safe DSLs, monad transformers and isolating side effects to 
enable good testability.

- `free-transactions`:

The project contains POC code that shows how to do transactions with free monads.
